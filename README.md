## Labs:
* The labs are starting on Jan 29th, so there will be no lab on Jan 22nd.
* The labs come with exercises as Python notebook.  A new set of exercises will be released every _TWO_ weeks.
* Material in the labs may appear in the exam.
* *The labs are the primary route for feedback on all aspects of the course, including lectures, any question sheets and exams, not just the labs!!!!*
* The lab exercises will be released in the /labs/ folder.
@@ _Lab1 is now available_ @@
* TAs: Xuan kong, Zheng Dong, Lucas Mockeridge, Harleen Gulati, Austin Long, Deep Pawar, Jeein Park

## Teams:
* The Teams Team is [[COMS20011: Data-Driven Computer Science 2023/24]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a0DQ-4IeBWTiBTCNmPvAmkc-CjNXlKFBJHObtpLyHaVw1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=5928cfed-1e17-4d2b-a3a7-4ab403410857&tenantId=b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b).  You should have access already through the "Teams" panel.  If not, please get in touch with the COMS Student Enquiries Mailbox at coms-student-enquiries@bristol.ac.uk

## Exam info:
* The course is assessed 100% by a multiple-choice exam.
* The exam will have 20 questions, worth 100 marks, and will be 2 hours. It does require a calculator (which must be non-programmable).
* If you have any questions regarding alternative exam arrangements, please get in touch with the COMS Student Enquiries Mailbox at coms-student-enquiries@bristol.ac.uk
* The exam is closed-book (so no additional materials are allowed). There will be a formulae sheet with the exam.


## Past exam papers:
* Example past papers will be released soon after Week 20.
